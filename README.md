**Q: Is this safe?**
A: Yes! BoostPro only makes temporary changes. Services can be restarted, and registry changes can be reverted. Nothing is permanently deleted.

**Q: Do I need to run this every time?**
A: Some optimizations (like clearing RAM) should be run before gaming sessions. Others (like disabling Game DVR) persist until you restore them.

**Q: Will this break anything?**
A: The stopped services are non-essential for gaming. If you experience issues, use the Restore button.

**Q: How much RAM will I get back?**
A: Typically 2-4GB depending on your system usage.
